          Calamity-prone areas like Narok, Kenya, continue to suffer severe losses due to floods, droughts, and other natural disasters. Despite advances in technology, there is a critical gap in real-time monitoring and early warning systems that can predict, detect, and alert people before disaster strikes. This leaves vulnerable populations exposed, unprepared, and unable to take preventive action.

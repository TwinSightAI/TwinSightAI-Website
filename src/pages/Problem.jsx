          <strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Environmental disasters such as floods, droughts, and soil degradation are becoming increasingly frequent and severe due to climate change and unsustainable practices. The lack of real-time, data-driven insights into environmental and agricultural conditions hampers the ability of farmers, institutions, and governments to detect risks early, respond effectively, and implement preventive measures. Traditional observation and reporting methods are reactive, fragmented, and often delayedâ€”leading to poor resource allocation, reduced agricultural productivity, and increased vulnerability of ecosystems and communities.
